## Contents
* `rl_tutorial_trend2024.ipynb`: this is the notebook we will go through for the tutorial! It will throw errors if you try to run it all the way through. We'll add code to make it run during the tutorial.
* `solutions.ipynb`: this has solutions to the coding exercises (spoilers). Don't open it if you want to rely on your own solutions to the coding problems. However, feel free to reference it if you are stuck. Some of the exercises are coding exercises, others are conceptual questions based on the code. If you are stuck on the code and want to run experiments, you can use this.
* `plotting.py`: has some convenience functions for plotting. You shouldn't need to look at this, but feel free (it's not very well documented). 
* `env_utils.py`: has some convenience functions for setting up environments. You shouldn't need to look at this, but feel free (it's not very well documented either).
